# Stop Cleaning Logs. Start Emitting Decisions.

Modern analytics teams are archaeologists.

We dig through logs, reconstruct intent, and guess why systems behaved the way they did. This is not a tooling problem. It is an architectural one. Systems emit artifacts, not decisions.

Until decisions become first-class data objects, analytics will remain reactive cleanup.

Decision Telemetry proposes a shift:

Decisions should emit their own explanation at runtime.  
Analytics should consume intent, not infer it.

Structure without meaning is fragile.  
Meaning without structure is chaos.

Decision contracts unify both.

When systems declare decisions explicitly — outcomes, evidence, lineage — analytics becomes predictable, explainable, and auditable by design.

This is not a framework.  
It is an architectural maturity step.

Stop reverse engineering behavior.  
Start instrumenting intent.
